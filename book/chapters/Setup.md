# Setup

There are some assumptions made in this book. Please read this chapter to make sure you understand what
is needed to use the code examples in this book. Especially, if you are going to use a different OS,
or a different distribution of Linux, or a different version of ROS, then it is totally your responsibility
to adjust everything from this book to work with your setup.

*__HC SVNT DRACONES__* (Here be dragons). Diverging from the assumptions made here can be a non trivial task.

This book provides code examples that you can use to learn about robotics.
The code examples and other materials are written in Python, C++, XML, text and in other forms.
The examples are designed primarily to be run on a computer with a Linux operating system using the Ubuntu distribution.
There are other OSes you could use, and other distributions, but I'm not going to cover them here.
Learing ROS is a steep enough learning curve without adding the complexity of different OSes and distributions.
I will leave that to you to figure out if you want to use something else.

The examples are tested in late 2024 using Linux Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and ROS Jazzy Jalisco.
Most of the material should work generally with ROS, but ROS evolves every day, so there may be some changes that need
to be made to the code to get it to work with the latest version of ROS.
Still, the concepts should be widly applicable.

You need to have ROS2 Jazzy Jalisco installed on your computer. Look, for example at the
ROS2 installation instructions^[See: https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html] for how to install ROS2 on your computer.

You also need to have a workspace set up for this book. You can use the following commands to set up a workspace for this book.
I'm assuming you will name the workspace `wr_book_ws`, but you can name it whatever you want.
It will be up to you to change any references in this book from wr_book_ws to whatever you name the book workspace.

```bash
# Do the following if you haven't already created a workspace for this book code.
mkdir -p ~/wr_book_ws/src && cd ~/wr_book_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:wimblerobotics/Robotics_Book.git
cd .. # Should be back at ~/wr_book_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

If you are looking to get the latest changes for this book, you can do the following:

```bash
cd ~/wr_book_ws/src/Robotics_Book
git pull
cd ~/wr_book_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

Whenever you start a new terminal, you will need to source the setup.bash file in the install directory of your workspace.
You can add the following line to your `.bashrc` file to automatically source the setup.bash file whenever you start a new terminal.

```bash 
echo "source ~/wr_book_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

The reason for needing to source the setup.bash file will be explained further in the chapter dealing with workspaces and overlays
