I’ll quickly scan for key files in the TeensyCode package to scope the analysis. Here’s a focused review of the TeensyCode package with concrete, safe improvements you can make next. No changes applied yet.

Checklist of improvement areas
- ISR design and concurrency
- Timing model and CPU load
- Echo mapping robustness
- Memory and Strings on embedded
- API and lifecycle consistency
- Diagnostics and safety
- Math and constants
- Code structure and style
- Build/config hygiene

Suggestions

1) Keep ISRs minimal and safe
- Don’t call Serial.print inside interrupts. In sonar.cpp, handleEcho() (called from echo_interrupt_handler ISR) prints when a “spurious interrupt” occurs. Move all logging to loop() by setting a diagnostic flag or ring buffer.
- Accessed from both ISR and main loop: Device fields (echo_found, distance, countdown_ticks, waitout_countdown_ticks). Mark those that cross ISR/loop boundary as volatile (or protect accesses using noInterrupts()/interrupts() around short critical reads/writes). At minimum: echo_found, distance, countdown_ticks, waitout_countdown_ticks should be volatile or copied atomically.

2) Reduce timer ISR load (10 µs is too aggressive)
- Timer1 at 10 µs tick creates 100 kHz ISR load. Your longest countdown is 150 ms → 15,000 ticks. That’s very expensive CPU-wise.
- Use a larger base period: 50–100 µs (or 1 ms) is usually sufficient to manage 40 ms echo windows and 150 ms waitouts with negligible accuracy loss.
- Even better: eliminate tick counters and use time-based deadlines with micros(): store timestamps and compare (micros() - start >= interval). This can run in loop() or a much lighter ISR.

3) More robust echo-to-sensor mapping
- You attach the same echo ISR for all pins, then rely on current_sensor_index_. If current_sensor_index_ advances between the HIGH and LOW edges (or an unexpected edge occurs), you can associate the echo with the wrong device.
- Safer options:
  - Track last state for each echo pin and, inside the ISR, poll all enabled echo pins and detect which pin actually changed, then use a map from pin→device index.
  - Trigger only one sensor at a time (as you do), but freeze current_sensor_index_ until a LOW is seen or timeout occurs (i.e., don’t advance index while echo is active).
  - Teensy-specific: attach distinct ISRs per pin (Teensy supports separate attachInterrupt calls), each ISR sets a per-device flag so you don’t rely on a global index.

4) Lifecycle and configuration
- configureSensor() only updates the array. If configure happens after setup(), pins and interrupts aren’t (re)configured. Provide enableSensor()/disableSensor() that handle pinMode, attach/detachInterrupt, and state reset. Alternatively, make configureSensor() idempotent and side-effectful (re-wire when enabled changes).
- Validate inputs: ensure index < kMaxSonarSensors, pins are sane, and reject overlapping trigger/echo pins.

5) Memory hygiene: avoid Arduino String in Device
- Device.name and several SerialManager APIs use Arduino String. On long-running embedded systems, this risks heap fragmentation.
- Prefer fixed-size char arrays for names (e.g., char name[16]) or const char* pointing to static storage. You already had status-name issues; standardize on a fixed-size buffer in Device and copy-in during configureSensor().

6) Echo math and constants
- Inline named constants for speed of sound and units:
  - constexpr float kSpeedOfSound_m_per_us = 0.000343f; // 343 m/s
  - distance_m = echo_duration_us * kSpeedOfSound_m_per_us / 2.0f;
- Optional: Temperature compensation (speed varies with ambient temperature). Provide a configurable speed-of-sound parameter or a helper to compute it from temperature.
- Clarify units for distance everywhere (meters in Device.distance). Consider offering a helper to convert to cm for logs to avoid ad-hoc conversions.

7) State machine clarity and safety
- State transitions in timerInterruptHandler() are correct but do a lot (loop to find next sensor, writes, arithmetic). Prefer a simpler ISR that only toggles pins and sets deadlines; keep the scheduling logic in loop().
- WAIT_OUT_ECHO: when waitout expires, ensure echo_found=false and distance=max_range is set atomically/via volatile. Consider also setting a “valid” flag so consumers can distinguish “no echo” from “stale value”.

8) Diagnostics and rate control
- loop() emits “Sonar <name> distance…” every 200 ms for all devices. This can be a lot of traffic. Add a per-device changed/valid flag and suppress unchanged reports, or allow configuring the report period.
- Provide minimal error counters (spurious interrupts, missed LOW, timeouts) per device and report periodically.

9) Consistent naming and API
- Rename Device to SonarChannel or SonarDevice for clarity.
- Expose a read-only accessor for per-device data: const Device& getDevice(i) or a trimmed DTO (distance, valid, last_us).
- Return optional/NaN for “no echo” instead of forcing max_distance value, or maintain an explicit is_valid boolean.

10) Singleton and memory usage
- The singleton uses new; on embedded it’s okay, but you can avoid dynamic allocation: static SonarMonitor instance; return reference. This saves heap and avoids fragmentation.
- Ensure instance_ is not used before setup; guard echo ISR against null as you already do.

11) Use Teensy-native timers
- On Teensy 4.x, IntervalTimer is the canonical API. TimerOne may work but is less idiomatic. Consider IntervalTimer for better control and clarity on Teensy.

12) Build and config hygiene
- Ensure clang-format config is applied consistently and VS Code uses clang-format (not VCFormat). You already tightened .clang-format; keep BreakBeforeBraces: Attach to match your chosen style.
- Consider a small README.md in TeensyCode documenting:
  - Wiring for HC-SR04 pins
  - Timer period selected and rationale
  - Max ranges/timeouts used (40 ms echo window, 150 ms waitout)
  - Any known quirks (134 ms real device behavior)

13) Testing hooks
- Add a “simulation” mode to feed synthetic echo durations to validate state machine without hardware.
- Minimal benchmark: measure ISR load and loop frequency (you have a PerformanceMonitor module—leverage it to report ISR timing/overruns if possible).

14) SerialManager improvements (optional)
- Current design uses String a lot; if fragmentation becomes an issue, switch to fixed-size buffers and snprintf.
- Add backpressure handling in sendMessage (non-blocking, queue stats you already track). Expose queue_high_water_mark via a getter for monitoring.

15) Edge cases and overflows
- micros() overflow is fine with unsigned math, but document it and ensure all deltas use unsigned subtraction.
- When calculating distance on very long echoes, clamp to max_distance to avoid spurious big numbers.

If you want, I can prototype a lighter, time-based scheduler (no 10 µs ISR) and a pin→device mapping ISR that’s safe under edge timing, as a follow-up.
